        Sharepoint is a web-based collaborative platform that integrates with Microsoft Office. It is primarily sold as a document management and storage system, but the product is highly configurable and usage varies substantially among organizations. SharePoint provides a secure place to store, organize, share, and access information from any device. It can be used to create websites, manage workflows, and build custom web applications. It also offers features for data storage, retrieval, search, archiving, tracking, management, and reporting. SharePoint is used by many businesses to create intranets, secure document management, collaboration, and project management sites.
